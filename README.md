pages-children
==============

The Pages-Children plugin now works with any post or taxonomy type which is setup as hierarchical.

Personally I find the WordPress Pages management somewhat lacking. When dealing with a simple list of About Us, Contact Us, etc. pages the interface works fairly well. But when you have a client who has 15+ levels of sub-pages and each level contains some 50+ pages the interface quickly breaks down in it's usefulness.

So I put together a plugin to help manage this a little better. The new plugin, pages-children, helps to filter the post type or taxonomy list showing only a single level of at a time. That is it really. There is no admin interface or settings. Just through the power of the WordPress actions and filter the page content can be altered. Powerful stuff.
